I automated a big chunk of my daily workflows with an AI agent, then open-sourced the setup guide I wish I had on day one.

GitHub repo:
https://github.com/zach-highley/openclaw-starter-kit

What I focused on:
- uptime with `launchd/systemd` + one daily maintenance job
- security defaults that reduce avoidable mistakes
- model fallback + memory settings for long sessions
- clear operating rules from auditing 355 config options

The main takeaway: reliability came from removing complexity, not adding another monitoring layer.

If you’re building with OpenClaw, I’d appreciate a star and your feedback.

If you deploy this, I’d love to hear what held up and what broke.
