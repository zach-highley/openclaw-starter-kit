# Then run:
#   python3 scripts/gh_issue_triage.py --dry-run
#   python3 scripts/gh_issue_triage.py --apply
#
# The gh CLI must be authenticated and have repo permissions.

[repo]
# REQUIRED: "owner/name" (example below)
full_name = "zach-highley/openclaw-starter-kit"
# Usually "main" but make it match your repo
default_branch = "main"

[bot]
# Used for git commits created by the autofix flow.
# NOTE: GitHub issue comments will be authored by whichever account your GH token belongs to.
# These values only affect commit metadata + the signature inside comments.

[autofix]
# Safety switch. If false, bot will NOT open PRs or commit anything.
enabled = false

# Autofix rules are opt-in and label-driven.
# The bot will only run a rule if the issue has the matching label.
#
# Example:
#
# [[autofix.rules]]
# name = "readme-typo"
# issue_label = "autofix:readme-typo"
# commands = [
#   "python3 scripts/some_fix_script.py",
#   "python3 -m compileall -q .",
# ]
