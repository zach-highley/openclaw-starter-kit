## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-03

### ⚠️ BREAKING: Philosophy Shift

This release represents a fundamental change in approach. **Simple > Clever.**

The old approach (v1-v2) recommended building layers of monitoring: watchdogs, meta-monitors, security hounds, config guardians. **That was wrong.** Those systems fought each other and caused more downtime than they prevented.

The new approach: Trust the platform. Launchd IS the watchdog. One cron for maintenance. That's it.

### Changed
- **README.md** — Complete rewrite. Added honest disclaimer (no guarantees, I break stuff, not affiliated with OpenClaw). Removed all references to deprecated monitoring systems. Now documents what actually works.
- Archived 13 legacy monitoring scripts to `scripts/archive/legacy-monitors/`:
  - watchdog.sh, watchdog_learn.sh
  - meta_monitor.py
  - security_hound.py
  - auto_doctor.py
  - autonomous_work_loop.py
  - subagent_watcher.py
  - context_healer.py
  - error_recovery.py
  - pipeline_health.py
  - agent_poll_enforcer.py
  - session_reset_monitor.py
  - telegram_delivery_checker.py

### Added
- `docs/CONFIG_HYGIENE.md` — Guide for keeping config clean: workspace defaults, secrets migration to `.env`, `${VAR}` substitution, audit checklist. Lessons from 817MB cleanup sprint.
- `docs/INCIDENT_POSTMORTEM.md` — **BRUTALLY HONEST**: The full embarrassing story of how I broke my own system for 6 hours by over-engineering. Required reading before you build custom watchdogs.
- `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED_STABILITY.md` — **CRITICAL**: Major incident analysis from 2026-02-03. Over-engineering killed my system. Launchd IS the watchdog.
- `docs/THE_11_COMMANDMENTS.md` — Hard-won rules for keeping autonomous OpenClaw stable.
- `docs/AUTONOMY_CADENCE.md` — minimal, MECE autonomy cadence (hourly updates, twice-daily recaps, daily docs upkeep).
- `docs/DELIVERY_GOTCHAS.md` — how to avoid the "job ran but nothing delivered" failure mode (systemEvent vs agentTurn).
- `docs/PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md` — public-safe operating philosophy.
- `config/examples/autonomy-cadence.json5` — safe, user-agnostic config snippet (timezone, typing indicators, heartbeat + messaging defaults).
- Safe out-of-band gateway watchdog package (opt-in): `tools/watchdog/*` + docs `docs/WATCHDOG_OOB_SAFE.md`.

### Changed
- **README.md** — Major update with warning about over-engineering. Added prominent notice pointing to LESSONS_LEARNED_STABILITY.md.
- Self-healing loop section now recommends simple approach (launchd + 5 AM cron) over complex multi-layer monitoring.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- `docs/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` — how to use OpenClaw sub-agents for bulk structured content generation (JSON articles, curriculum, educational content). Includes schema design, parallel dispatch, fact-checking, token economics, and common pitfalls.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- `docs/SIMPLIFICATION_GUIDE.md` — comprehensive guide to cutting bloat: 75 scripts → 25, 18 crons → 10, replacing custom monitoring with OpenClaw built-in tools (`openclaw doctor`, `openclaw status --deep`). Based on OpenClaw creator's philosophy.

### Changed
- Archived 11 outdated docs (meta-monitor, watchdog, agent poll enforcer, sprint system, etc.) to `docs/archive/`
- Docs now reflect simplified approach: fewer scripts, built-in tools, minimal heartbeat

### Removed
- References to "Council" pattern (named monitoring scripts watching each other)
- Over-engineered self-healing protocols (OpenClaw handles this natively)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- `docs/EMAIL_IMESSAGE_AUTOMATION.md` — comprehensive guide: Gmail MECE labels, server-side filters, Apple Mail Smart Mailboxes (with correct sub-label matching), Apple Mail Rules cleanup, iMessage security policy, VIP email scanner pattern
- `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md` — template for running full security audits (secrets, permissions, network, dashboards, public repos)

### Fixed
- Documented common Apple Mail Smart Mailbox mistake: criteria must match **leaf** mailbox names (e.g., "Reply") not parent label paths (e.g., "Action/Reply")

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed

- Corrected failover guide to use single-subscription pattern as default (not everyone has two accounts)

### Removed
- `SPRINT_REBRAND_SPEC.md` — internal planning doc, should not have been in public repo
- `scripts/__pycache__/` — compiled Python cache files removed, added to `.gitignore`
