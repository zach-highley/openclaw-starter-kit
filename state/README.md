# state/ (public repo)

This folder contains **example** state files used by the starter kit docs.

Why examples?
- Your real state is personal (tasks, reminders, accounts, and sometimes sensitive context).
- The starter kit is meant to be safe-by-default, so we ship *templates* you can copy.

What you should do:
- Copy the examples into your **private** OpenClaw workspace (or private fork) and let the agent maintain them.

Files:
- `current_work.example.json` — example task queue shape
- `codex_status.example.json` — example usage/status structure
- `work_metrics.example.json` — example metrics structure

If you want “always fresh” public state, use **docs + changelog** (not live state files).
